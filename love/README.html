<p>This project is based on <a href="http://github.com/hackerzhou/Love" target="_blank" rel="external">hackerzhou’s Love project</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve made some modifications to this project to send it as present for my girl’s graduation and out four year anniversary.</p>
<p>Before this project, I knowed little about fronted development. What I had modified or added is straightforward, there maybe even some errors. What ever, I consider it as a good try.</p>
